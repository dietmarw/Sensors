Sensors
=======

This is a library of sensor models (and associated tests).  They were
inspired by [a blog post](http://blog.xogeny.com) I wrote and I wanted
to share them with the Modelica community.

I'd like to see this library grow over time into a more complete set
of typical "real world" sensor models.  So I welcome contributions.
Just fork the repository and send me a pull request!

In this package, you will find a `Tests` package.  The `Tests` package
is for testing and the models contained in that package require the
[`XogenyTest`](https://github.com/xogeny/XogenyTest) package in order
compile.
